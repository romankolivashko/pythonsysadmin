Tuples

Tuples are a fixed width, immutable sequence type. We create tuples using parenthesis (( and )) and at least one comma (,):

>>> point = (2.0, 3.0)

Since tuples are immutable, we don’t have access to the same methods that we do on a list.
We can use tuples in some operations like concatenation, but we can’t change the original tuple that we created.

>>> point_3d = point + (4.0,)
>>> point_3d
(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

One interesting characterist of tuples is that we can unpack them into multiple variables at the same time:

>>> x, y, z = point_3d
>>> x
2.0
>>> y
3.0
>>> z
4.0

The time you’re most likely to see tuples will be when looking at a format string that’s compatible with Python 2:

>>> print("My name is: %s %s" % ("Keith", "Thompson"))
