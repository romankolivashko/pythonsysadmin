# Creating First Python Script
# Let’s create our first script to write our obligatory “Hello, World!” program:

$ vim hello.py
#From inside this file, we can enter the lines of Python that we need. For the “Hello, World!” example we only need:

print("Hello, World!")
#There are a few different ways that we can run this file. The first is by passing it to the python3.6 CLI:

$ python3.6 hello.py
Hello, World!

# Setting a Shebang
# You’ll most likely want your scripts to be:

Executable from anywhere (in our $PATH).
1. Executable without explicitly using the python3.6 CLI.
2. Thankfully, we can set the process to interpret our scripts by setting a shebang at the top of the file:

vim hello.py

#!/usr/bin/env python3.6
print("Hello, World")

# We’re not quite done; now we need to make the file executable using chmod:

$ chmod u+x hello.py

# Run the script now by using ./hello.py and we’ll see the same result. 
# If we’d rather not have a file extension on our script, 
# we can now remove that since we’ve put a shebang in the file mv hello.py hello, 
# and running ./hello will still result in the same thing.
